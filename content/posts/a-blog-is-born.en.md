This small corner of the internet will house my thoughts and learnings around software development, Kubernetes, and the cloud. By writing on this blog, I hope to fulfill these three goals:

- Share my technical expertise (particularly in **[Arabic](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language)**, my mother tongue)
- Motivate my continuous learning
- Establish an online presence

[Let me know](mailto:ali@dowair.com) if you have any suggestions or would like to see me write about a specific topic. Check back soon for the next post!
